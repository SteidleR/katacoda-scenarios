Congratulation! You've finished the katacoda "Spark and PySpark".

Let's recap what you learned in the last 10-15 minutes:

Throughout this katacoda scenario, you learned what Apache Spark is. You learned the benefits of Spark and its use cases in the big data and data warehouse area. <br /> 
Starting, you learned how a PySpark application is build and what a _SparkSession_ is. <br /> 
You got an insight into the possibilities of PySpark for data processing. Furthermore, You learned how to load a dataset from a file, how you can analyze and filter the data and how to transform data stored in a PySpark DataFrame.<br /> 
Last, you got an overview of the differences between PySpark and Pandas and how to use both frameworks together by converting the DataFrames between them.

Below you can find a list of all sources and references used in this scenario.
